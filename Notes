1. How to use the git diff to compare the commit with its parents.
    git show commit_ID
    (1). This commit is useful when you don't know the parent of the git commit if you merge two branches together.

    git log -n 1 
    (1). The n option shows that you specify the number of git log to show.

2. How to use the git push
    The git push takes two arguments
 The first is the remote name, and the other is the branch in the local that you want to send to the remote.
    The git pull takes two arguments 
 The first is the remote name, and the other is the branch you want to pull.
 Otherwise, there could be conflicts with the local and the remote repository.
